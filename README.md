## 🛠️ How It Works
- **Wheel Animation:** The entire wheel rotates continuously using the `@keyframes wheel` animation.
- **Cabin Animation:** Each cabin has a counter-rotation effect to stay upright, with color transitions from red to yellow and purple.
- **Lines:** Spokes are created using rotated `span` elements.

## 💡 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Keyframes & Animations)

## 📏 Customization
You can modify the:
- **Rotation Speed:** Adjust `animation-duration` in the `.wheel` class.
- **Cabin Colors:** Update keyframe color stops in `@keyframes cabins`.
- **Wheel Size:** Change `width` and `height` properties in the `.wheel` class.
